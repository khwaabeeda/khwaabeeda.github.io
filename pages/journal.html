       <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;">Found this receipt from Delhi Book Fair (1982) buried; holding moments between the stack of old Hindi books. Another pile of memory held together by dust. My grandfather would always bring back the most amazing things from wherever he went. According to Carl Jung, the best way to discover oneself and heal your inner turmoils is by tracing your childhood memories. The ones I was able to trace were (1.) my grandfather, (2.) the things he had, (3.) the things he brought back and (4.) the things he left behind. Left behind for me to find one day, because of consonance.

       <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;">The receipt is of a magazine subscription. The magazine was called SPAN. Found a cover page from SPAN magazine from February 1969. It is a shot of the Earth as seen from the moon by Apollo. My mind keeps going back to this image of the Earth, I keep on staring at it, taking in all details, zooming out zooming out, on the pale blue. Trying to force it into taking the form of some nostalgic memory from my childhood. Maybe I can fool my consciousness into storing it so. It was an experiment. So much pleasure I would get from a memory of a view of the Earth from some window that I was behind. To my appalment, this is not how memory works. Another failed experiment.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;">╾━╤デ╦︻(▀̿Ĺ̯▀̿ ̿)The idea that coinsidences simply DONOT exist. Even the chaos is so meticulously designed to appear as unbound by rhythm. But there is always rhythm. Always a beat that hits harder than the other, always a color that looks brighter than the other, always a heart that beats harder than the other, always a person who feels warmer than the other. Does this mean that we go around searching for our musical consonances everywhere we go, in every moment? Such a heartbreaking experience that would be, to find out just how many things and people and moments are just not meant for me.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;">If one would zoom on the map to the Homunculus, one notices that the map is circular. The reason is that you will not find the Homunculus there when you reach there the first time, the third time, or the fifth time. You have to take part in a play of entropy. You have to go to Phuktal first, and then make a round trip back to the Homunculus. Only when you make a round trip can you find the Homunculus. It's not like the Homunculus goes off to eat some Khambir or howl at the moon. In fact, the Homunculus never leaves the cave. However, the Homunculus like myself has a shifted sense of time and space. And exists only in a circular sense of it. Can only exist for you and me in evens, no odds.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;"> A few years back I decided I wanted to go visit a Homunculus hibernating inside the highest Ladakhi caves. The caves are just like those in Nicholas Roerich's sketches. On the wall of Homunculu's cave was the quote <i>"Solitude will transmit the message better than the murmurs of crowds."</i> The cave reflected the meditating Ladakhi sky. On one corner of the wall, I could see the laws of thermodynamics scribbled out. I had only heard the stories (there were not many) and was keen to share the same cave myself. However, fate decided to put me on another path and ended up not going. Instead, I was in Delhi, lying in sweat and naked on a filthy hostel bed, smoking away to the beautiful realities of entropy myself. You can find me soaking up the energies of the sun just to contribute more to the chaos. It has been 5 years maybe (I have been having trouble putting numbers on my past), and I have been craving the same cave again. Aren't paths that are made because of people walking on them too much called 'desire paths'?

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;"> I have been responsible for my own demise into madness. It takes a great deal of ego and selfish motives to hold oneself responsible for such a thing. Smoke fills my lungs, flow my tears. Is there some way to find me a dose of KR-3? Let me fall into that lap of space where no one remembers me. I wonder if, in that part of space and time, I descend into madness or not. Am I happy there? Such a paradoxical question. What if I choke down on some KR-3 only to find that no one is happy anywhere? In no universe, in no space-time. Every form of my existence is living off the hope, that maybe some part of me in XYZ land is sleeping in content. Flow my tears, what a fool. If I could stop I would. But now is not the time, or the space.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;"> “She is always in trouble”. Nawab could be my escape from all the trouble. I could live peacefully. I could be one of those very simple and uninteresting people that you cannot help but ignore and move on. Is my name written somewhere on his palm? Do our lines meet? More importantly, do I want them to? Heraclitus said; “No man ever steps in the same river twice. For it's not the same river and he's not the same man.” Further he explains that “The meaning of the river flowing is not that all things are changing so that we cannot encounter them twice but that some things stay the same only by changing.” Sitting on top of a mountain in Bahang(Manali), chillum in hand (his hand), he sits looking at my face while my lips curl adjacent to his fist enabling the smoke to fill my lungs.

       <div class="second">


    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;"> Nawab does not know, that with every moment where I am placed in his moving jeep, he is saving moments of me. That is how it is with some souls. They need saving from every moment. In the moments that they are not saved, they manage to get themselves in more loss, more hurt, more sorrow. Temporal healing has been helping me relocate myself in time. I have been keeping track of moments. Momentary existence or ksanikavâda. The Buddhist doctrine where life exists not as a series of events being preserved materially, but as moments. Each moment that follows, follows only when the current is annihilated. Only complete destruction of a moment will lead to the existence of another. Only when I am completely indulged and swallowed by the moment, can I annihilate it, otherwise, I will always be stuck in some uncomfortable, inconvenient gap.

       <div class="second">


    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;"> “You're extremely careless.” Nawab does not know. How would he, I never told him. And It is okay. Not everything is meant to be known. I am sure plenty people save plenty people on a momentary basis and have not even a slight idea about their deed. It is not out of carelessness or chance that it happens, At least I do not think so. Some things are better left unsaid for the very decency of it. A kind gesture on the chaos’ part, to not let us get over our heads too much. I see him filling his lungs with the same smoke that fills mine. I see him struggling with life. I had a lot of questions to ask him that I never did. But that is okay, some things are also better left unasked.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;">  My mind keeps going back to the nights I spent in JNU. I always felt choked in those dirty beds. The air of the university stinks of pathetic desperation of illiterate blank souls. A place for people with no use or purpose in the outside world. A waste of entropy? [No, nothing is a waste to entropy, that's the beauty of it.] A garbage dump, my grandfather used to say. A dump indeed, and everyone that lives there fits right in like they were born to be discarded in those dirty disgusting beds, fitting right in. I have seen many a naked soul but none as uninteresting as the ones I saw there. It is a dull place, for dull minds. I breathed so much of it in that that feeling of dullness never left my bones.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;"> “You will always need to find some escape from reality because you cannot help it.” My grandfather said while handing me over a set of hard-bound Hindi books of love poems. At that time, they did not make much sense to me and seemed inappropriate and mindless. I always thought a person should foremost love their work, then their passion and then themselves. The notion of romantic love came in the way of my sexual desires. There aren't many men out there who know how to balance between a slap and a kiss, so I prioritized the slap.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;"> I make tea the way Rehman taught me. I brush after every meal because that is how my father did it. I laugh more at life because that is how Nawab did it. I write in books next to my favourite parts because my grandfather did it. I listen to music a little more different every few years. Some songs I cannot listen to anymore with the same smile because they remind me of some things I loved and lost. I collect little things like bills from restaurants, small toys, and broken things because they remind me of good and bad memories. I do my hair a little differently every time someone compliments me a certain way. We become so much of who we are from the people we meet. Patches of memories and feelings, soothing and harsh, wanted or unwanted but still there.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;"> Two years ago I stopped volunteering. I used to volunteer regularly all around northern India. I have been connected with many volunteering agencies, NGOs, and welfare institutes for years. Two years ago I was volunteering at an orphanage. The task was to build a library. Till now everywhere I volunteered I could see smiles and hugs and tears. It made me feel fulfilled, with a sense of satisfaction always filling up my heart, and a sense of hope in my soul. Two years ago I looked closer, and as I was about to reach the orphanage, the kids saw me approaching and started rubbing mud on their faces. Some picked up cow dung and rubbed it on their sleeves. Some pinched their hair and made it messy. A pan of darkness ran across my whole body, something held my throat, choked it and laughed at me. I turned around never to come back. I can still feel it choking me, I can still hear the laughter.

I could hand it over to anyone who I want in my life, I will not have to print many copies. It would be hardbound, the cover would be me on my knees, head down, in my most vulnerable state, my present state.

The enormous pang of unbearable pain that hits me every time I wake, became a little more bearable at this moment, this moment as I record is 0356am. Interpret it as whatever, that is the beauty of words, phrases, art, and paintings, so fluid. I can make them to be whatever I want. It is more bearable not because I was comforted somehow by kind soft words, or because some love or care came my way out of the blue. It is more bearable because, with every unbearable pang, I stop feeling a little more. It is a biological defence mechanism that I read about in a journal 15 years back. It is as natural as breathing and as healthy as sleeping. My mind is doing me a favor, and I am letting it.

It is an unsung idiosyncrasy of mine. But this new sim is more special to me. I have a strange attachment to it and never wish to lose it. I bought it in Bahang (Manali) from a very small shop situated right opposite the <i>theka</i> that I frequented every day. The store owner asked me if I have lost my phone, I said yes but that it was nothing new I kept losing and finding it all the time. He looked right at my face with such a strange expression and said, “Sounds like you’re talking about yourself memsahab”.

And when I am outright insane, I am dancing. <i>"And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music"</i>.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;"> Tender is the night, only for those who cannot spell 'tender'. It is a weird figure of speech that an old German drunk in an old Russian sidedoor bar (in St. Petersberg) slurred at me. I have a distant relationship with the word 'tender'. I have a lack of experience in the context in which such a word can be placed. But the very limited experience that I had always left me wanting more. Obviously, my lifestyle is busy pursuing other things.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;"> I have been keeping track of moments. These moments revisit me often, and very often I get lost in them. It is not just my moments that I have tracked and stored. With very few people I 'talk', and when I do they share glimpses of their own momentary existence with me, and I form a short illustrated storyboard of their moments in my head. Some are very detailed, some vague. I have filled the vague gaps in vague moments (all falling prey to my need for closure). It is okay sometimes, but other times these same moments come to haunt me. For I have no control over what I store. Even the most unwanted little clipets sit clearly in my head. "It is easier to heal cuts when there is no one to see." I see.

For someone who does not read, he has a keen eye. How is it possible to have collected such brilliant literature, without knowing it? If I could, I would steal away every one of them for my own.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;">There are moments when I am thinking hard about something, and I can see traces of it in real life. It happens to everyone. Carl Sagan would say it is all a part of the fact that there are always cosmic connections and with that our very human need to feel connected with the cosmos. Tesla would say that it is radio waves from the universe, because the radio waves are uniform for everyone and everything, people and their environment act similarly. I have always had trouble facing these theories, I have always been distant from the cosmos, distant from the environment and even more distant from the people in it. The last time I thought I felt a connection, I ended up looking like a fool. My emotional needs wanted the connection to play out so hard, that in the hustle to make it work I crashed hard. I do not wish to recover from the crash. I have embraced it. It could be some radio waves, I refuse to believe that I have become weak.

He was an ex-military doctor and always spoke of scars. He believed that scars are nothing but maps to understand what parts of us need the most care. A soft slow finger will one day trace these maps and send delicate pangs of ecstasy in my heart. Tears will fill the corner of my eye. I will feel a little more that day.

I see it in my hands, bleeding, and there is nothing I can do. And then I look down at myself bleeding, and there is nothing I can do. So I am just going to let it bleed out.

There will be a formal coherence between the idea and the purpose of the book. The book will be aesthetically and philosophically nurtured. Special attention will be given to the book as an object. I am interested in pursuing the idea that each object (each book in this case) in the process of being produced carries with itself a purpose as well, an essence of some sort. And its essence is only realised when in the hands of some conscious observer, like me and you. Each book in each individual conscious hand is revealed as itself only to that hand, and that touch, and that nose and those eyes. That's how I want to design my books, to have in them so much sensual potential that they make the holder shiver.

Intoxicated out of my mind, feeling nauseated between crowds of people I do not know, I made my way to the terrace of the farmhouse. In the dark with the faded yet loud music drumming my ears while I stare right at the night sky. Looking for some signs from the cosmos, some shooting star for me to wish on, some map in the constellations for me to follow, some radio wave to guide me to someplace I can sleep. *3 HOURS BACK* Feels like we left Dwarka hours back and still have not reached our location. It's supposed to be a farmhouse somewhere in Greater Noida, the people who invited me, have only heard stories of me. I have no clue who these people are, and it's good, I feel no sense of obligation to communicate. I can be the girl at the party, sitting in a corner, or on a terrace with earphones in, cigarette lit, dancing occasionally, not looking at anyone in particular, dancing a little more. *3 HOURS LATER* Holly Golightly's voice is drowning out the loud techno music in the background, I am on the song 'slowly but surely'. It is one of my favourite songs of hers. My desperation for some cosmic signal to shoot my way went right into my head and there it was, it was raining butterflies. <b> <i> And sometimes I have to cry

I feel eyes on me. I can only hear the loud music ringing into my ear while I dance away in the middle of the room. Some hand tried to pull me out of my solitudal dance routine and failed, and another tried and failed. And there were the eyes, watching a body painted gold and dancing away at 4am. Can they see the love bites the butterflies left on me? Can they see the pink flowers grooving away with me? Or have the flowers turned gold too?

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;">I have started being better than yesterday, each day, one day at a time, on my own but better. I just need to keep breathing. I have become a violent ocean. For so long struggling against the pull of the moon. But the sun will rise tomorrow. And who knows what the tide will bring to me.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;">I have been taking long seemingly futile (to the other) walks by the ocean again. It has been months and I am back here. This place, this sand to my feet, the air in my hair, the waves stealing a touch of my skin. I am back here. Last night I was walking by the ocean in the absolute dark. Some butterfly must have fluttered its wings because involuntarily I started walking with my eyes closed. It was as if the sound of the violent lunar waves hitting the soft warm sand had become my sense of sight. The waves were taking over as my senses were pulling me closer to them, I could feel them at my feet and yet the overwhelm took over me and kept me from giving control back to my eyes, to sense, to logic. The human fears, tears, and time took over and I finally did open my eyes. Half in water half in land. I am back here.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;">The pace has changed today, change is the only constant. But it's rather slow, we miss it every day, lost in our fast lives. Unbothered we keep running. But I felt it today. Under my skin, the feeling of change has settled and it will not go away, at least I hope so. Holding onto the present like that crow in the sand holding on to what remains of the dead fish. I felt it. The very fragile momentary in the vastness of what we call a moment. In it, I could feel my feet burying in the sand, and as I let my thoughts flow with the wind, I almost hoped the sand would take me all in. I was not looking at the ocean so as to ask for it to engulf me today. It was the sand. it kept trying and I involuntary kept moving. That's life. Holding onto itself I guess.

<br>What do you do to find peace in yourself?
<br>Step out. Make plans last minute. Just go. Lie to ten people about your destination, as long as you
are honest with yourself. Stay silent about what you feel about someone. As long as you are not silent to
yourself. Let your actions speak. You deserve that much and more. Heal people, let people heal you,
let your destination heal you, let your bus ride heal you, let your journeys heal you. Listen to what
they are saying, watch the water drop for hours, watch a person read in the dark under the only light
they find, sit alone in dark rooms for hours, and let your music speak. Take space, give space. Smile at the
small droplets of water on small flowers after the rain. Wear shades outdoors, indoors, in light, in
dark. Wear the biggest T-shirt you own. You don’t want to be seen, don’t be seen. Disappear. As long
as you find peace with yourself.
Let the momentary make you smile. Let the little insignificant feelings develop. Embrace this
insignificance of the small over the big picture. Mosaic is your way of life and so let those pieces
misfit. Imperfection is brave. If one day after living for 10,000 days you want to sit and write it all
down, have 20,000 pages in hand.
Give your own meaning to what a year means, what a month means, what a day means, what a
second means and most importantly what a moment means. Free yourself of the measurements
existing between numbers 1 and 12. Your time can be the tip ap of the raindrops or let the thunder
denote your hours.
As long as you don’t justify those 20,000 pages to anyone.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;">The rising and swelling of the waters of the ocean (flood-tide)
occasioned by the influence of the moon was to the eye of the Sanskrit poets an indication of the ocean's delight. Have been feeling that ocean in my soul today. The poets romanticized my pain. And I like a fool, decided on my faith, as the tragically beautiful. ‧₊˚ ☁️⋅♡𓂃 ࣪ ִֶָ☾.
