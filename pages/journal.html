       <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;">Found this reciept from Delhi Book Fair (1982) burried, holding moments between the stack of old hindi books. My grandfather would always bring back the most amazing things back from wherever he went. I am not the person who has a lot of memories stored from their childhood. Carl Jung says the best way to discover oneself is by tracing your childhood memories. The only ones I have (or I like to pretent there is nothing else) are of my grandfather and the things he had. The things he brought back. And the things he left behind. Left behind for me to find one day because I am definitely a believer of consonance.
