       <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;">Found this reciept from Delhi Book Fair (1982) burried; holding moments between the stack of old hindi books. My grandfather would always bring back the most amazing things back from wherever he went. According to Carl Jung the best way to discover oneself and heal your inner termoils is by tracing your childhood memories. The only ones I have (or I like to pretent there is nothing else) are of (1.) my grandfather, (2.) the things he had, (3.) the things he brought back and (4.) the things he left behind. Left behind for me to find one day, because consonance.

       <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;">Inspected that reciept more and found that it was for a magazine subscription. The magazine was called SPAN. Found a cover page from SPAN magazine from February 1969. It is a shot of the Earth as seen from moon by apollo. Obsessed more over it because I am obsessed with all things old and rotting. And found another interesting article.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;">The article was not exactly about pain but how to deal with it (and so I did not read it). Meanwhile I sat peacefully inside a train of thoughts about pain related articles that I can write. They are: (1.) Why? (2.) Nevermind the why, what if pain is not just a feeling or a response to some chemical reactions but an actual living thing. Like a Homunculus? (3.) That homunculus idea is cool.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;">╾━╤デ╦︻(▀̿Ĺ̯▀̿ ̿)The idea that coinsidences simply DONOT exist. Even the chaos is so meticulously designed to appear as unbound by rythm. But there is always rythm. Always a beat that hits harder than the other, always a color that looks brighter than the other, always a heart that beats harder than the other, always a person who feels warmer than the other. Does this mean that we go around searching for our musical consonances everywhere we go, in every moment? Such a heartbreaking experience that would be, to find out just how many things and people and moments are just not meant for me.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;">If one zooms on the map to the Homunculous, one notices that the map is circular. The reason is that you will not find the Homunculous there when you reach there the first time, or the third time, or the fifth time. You have to go to Phuktal firt, and then make a round trip back to the Homunculous. Only when you make a round trip can you find the Homunculous. It is not like the Homunculous goes off to eat some Khambir, or howl at the moon. Infact, the Homunculous never leaves the cave. However, the Homunculous like myself has a shifted sense of time and space. And exists only in a circular sense of it. Hence the round trip. Can only exist for you and me in evens, no odds.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;"> Few years back I decided I wanted to go visit a Homunculous hibernating inside the highest Ladakhi caves. The caves just like those in Nicholas Roerich sketches. On the wall of Homunculou's cave was the quote <i>"Solitude will transmit the message better than the murmurs of crowds."</i> The cave reflected the meditating Ladakhi sky. I had only heard the stories (there were not many) and was keen to share the same cave myself. However, fate decided on putting me another path and ended up not going. Instead I was at JNU, lying in sweat and naked on a filthy hostel bed, smoking my desires away, legs open. It has been 5 years maybe (I have been having trouble putting numbers on my past), I have been craving the same cave again. Aren't paths that are made because of people walking on them called 'desire paths'?

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;"> I have been responsible for a man's demise into madness and alcoholism. It takes a great deal of ego and selfish motives to hold oneself responsible for such a thing. Smoke fills my lungs, flow my tears. Is there some way to find me a dose of KR-3? Let me fall into that lap of space where no one remembers me. I wonder if in that part of space and universe, that particular man, goes into madness or not. Is he happy there? Such a paradoxical question. What if I choke throat down of KR-3 only to find that no one is happy anywhere. In no universe, in no space-time. Every form of my existence is living off the hope, that maybe some part of me in XYZ land is sleeping in content. Flow my tears, what a fool. If I could stop I would. But now is not the time, or the space.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;"> “She is always in trouble”. Nawab could be my escape from all the trouble. I could live peacefully. I could be one of those very simple and uninteresting people that you cannot help but ignore and move on. Is my name written somewhere on his palm? Do our lines meet? More importantly, do I want them to? Heraclitus said; “No man ever steps in the same river twice. For it's not the same river and he's not the same man.” Further he explains that “The meaning of the river flowing is not that all things are changing so that we cannot encounter them twice but that some things stay the same only by changing.” Sitting on top of a mountain in Bahang(Manali), chillum in hand (his hand), he sits looking at my face while my lips curl adjacent his fist enabling the smoke to fill my lungs.

    <span "font-size:200%; "font-family:courier;"> Nawab does not know, that with every moment where I am placed in his moving jeep, he is saving moments of me. That is how it is with damaged souls. They need saving from every moment. In the moments that they are not saved, they manage to get themselves in more loss, more hurt, more sorrow. Temporal healing has been helping me relocate myself in time. I have been keeping track of moments. Momentary existence or ksanikavâda. The Buddhist doctrine where life exists not as a series of events being preserved materially, but as moments. Each moment that follows, follows only when the current is annihilated. Only complete destruction of a moment will lead to the existence of another. Only when I am completely indulged and swallowed by the moment, can I annihilate it, otherwise, I will always be stuck in some uncomfortable, inconvenient gap.
