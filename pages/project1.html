<br>
 <br>

“I tell you, we are here on Earth to fart around, <br>
<br>

 and don't let anybody tell you different.” <br>
<br>

 
― Kurt Vonnegut, A Man Without a Country <br>
<br>

L: ...that's it, the world, it's purely based on cosmic connections. <br>
<br>

G: How is it that you live with so much content in your heart? You're talking as if <br>it's a crime, a sin, dreadful!  <br>
<br>

L: Can be dreadful yes. It's another one of the inventions of course. <br>
<br>

G: They're all dreadful, aren't they?  <br>
<br>

L: The inventors. Yes, oh! The most dreadful of all inventors? Oh! The linguists! Oh! <br>The linguists! They do not feel a thing I tell you, these linguists! All words <br>no feel. Tragic low beings. We were just meant to express sounds I am telling <br>you. Just ‘ohs’, ‘Ahs’ and ‘Uhs’. What more do you need? The love of your life <br>the twinkle of your eye farts and you say “Ah.”. The old brute that ticks your <br>brain farts and you say “Oh!”. And the rest is all emotion. Can you not tell <br>the emotional gap between the “Ah.” and the “Oh!”? It's that simple. But 
<br>these dreaded linguists!  
<br>

G: ...What about biology?  <br>
<br>

L: Biology? What? The hum drum of what goes where?  <br>
<br>

G: What goes where?  <br>
<br>

L: Ah! No! You said it wrong! It's a harmony!  <br>
<br>

G: A bunch of tissues all working in harmony to sustain such tragic beings? I don't <br>think so... <br>
<br>

L: ...Oh, it's all just what goes where.  The phallic connections yes! The art of <br>having one's vagina holding another's penis? Of a vagina rubbing against another? Of a butt clenching?  <br>
<br>

G: No! No! rubbish. Why such a Freud? It's all just the intimate act of farting.  <br>
<br>

L: All farts no love. What's love and is it any better than a fart? <br>
<br>

G: Fool! Oh, what a fool! That's content! Fart! Oh! Fool! <br>
<br>

“I fart more than I fuck. <br>
<br>

And I fart better than I fuck.”  <br>
<br>

-Charles Bukowsky, Farting Is Much Like Fucking </center>
