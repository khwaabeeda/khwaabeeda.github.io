~ <br>

<p class="ex1">The following story is a first-hand account narrated to me by a dear friend. She claims that this narration is not just some event like that in conventional stories, where some significant event bears so much effect on an individual’s life that they consider it a moral epiphany; a life changing moment. Instead, it is as mundane as countless minutes in our lives that fall in the category of ‘routine’. The most unaccounted for, yet the most regimental moments of our experiences. “Do such events even exist? The epiphanies?” Or are they just fragmentations of a creative mind? Passed on under the pretext of so called “life changing event”. Such a redundant train of thought. If I happened upon a time travelling machine, I would not hop on it to the 17th century London to find out if the late Thomas Hood did too in fact tell the old Thackeray that joke. And so, if we are to assign our existence this literary element, where there is a hook, a body with catchy twists and a conclusion, this narrative is the purposeless redundant part of the story that editors cut out to meet the word limit. <br>

You are not in a place; the place is in you. <br>

Angelus Silesius <br>
<br>
There was a burning sensation in my left eye, I blinked the blurriness away. It was a bead of sweat that rolled down the forehead of the man huffing and puffing breathlessly over me. He was looking straight to avoid looking directly at me. Breathing harder than it pains. Condensed beads of water rolled down his army cut hair in the form of sweat. Rolling down the hard lines of his forehead, down to circle the rim of his eyes, in them. hardships of extreme poverty draped by a sense of defeat. The salty bead rolled down further to finally wait at the tip of the round nose. Waiting; for some butterfly in the blossoming Mughal Garden to flutter its wings only to hush the sweat just enough so that it falls right into my eye. I was crouching with my face down in a dusty bush on a corner of the Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. The man was below average, too skinny and in too much of a fuss for his profession, only owning up to his pronouns; poor/Fauji [Soldier, Urdu], poor self/Fauji self. Poor was like many other people in poor’s profession, grounded in pseudo-reality, keeping poor eyes and Fauji mind diverted just enough so poor could shoot a load down my ass.<br>  
<br>
I had trouble breathing, forty degrees of scorching Delhi heat, face down in the bushes, ass up in the air, the leaves of the bush formed a pillow for me to rest my face on, butt hole expanded to the phat-phat-phat of skin slapping together. I heard a cough; was it poor? No! It was not poor, it was distant! Aha! I have heard this cough before, it's this city! Yes! Oh! This city! How could I not have recognized it before? <br> 
Yaad betrayed me as that cough got lost in the noise of tangled barbs of turmoil, and flurry of the traffic of this city.  <br>
<br>
Phat-phat-phat, fauji sweat dropped on my lips and I intuitively lick-lick-lick. There it was, the dust, gnashing my teeth. I turned my head to see poor face covered in dust. Fauji!? You too!? Had fauji spent some nights with fauji face in the dusty bushes? Was poor one of the many faces that rested on these bushes? Had poor thought about the bushes the way I did? Why not. Poor is as much a part of this city as this city is a part of poor. Like mine and every other dust covered face in this congested city. Anyways, I was there in that corner selling my tight asshole, sometimes my mouth rarely both, to just earn enough rupees to buy some roti. I wonder what the other dust covered faces were selling in this city to buy their roti? This city; that even in the rarest silent of silences I can hear coughing.  <br>
<br>
 In those rare silent of silences, I dreamt of poor, kneeling between my legs and reality poking poor right in fauji face and down poor throat. Following a tear that rolled down poor eyes, a butterfly fluttered its wings, and the tear hit the leaves covered thickly in dust. Playing into a prerequisite dialogue. Interactions unfolded between particles solid and liquid with a diameter smaller than 100 micrometers. These interactions were destined to play themselves out on a bush in a corner outside JNU.<br>  
<br>
“Have you ever noticed how there is always mitti [dust, Hindi] on the leaves of this bush? I asked fauji pursing my lipstick-stained lips harder to let the smoke from my bidi to sooth into my lungs. <br>
<br>
“I don’t know” he said too quickly between drags of his Classic.  <br>
<br>
“Well look it’s covered in mitti right now!” Is this conversation boring him? Should I talk about the stink of politics that lingers in the air around this university?  <br>
<br>
“Yeah, I see mitti, but that is the case for everything in Dilli.” Breathing out a drag he pointed at me. “Look at your own face.” <br>
<br>
“You’re such a kutta! [dog, Hindi]” I frowned rubbing my cheek with my hand. And I see it, the dust.  
<br>
“Yeah, I prefer you call me kutta.” I see fauji smoke-stained black chapped lips smirking.  
<br>
“Kutta?” 
<br>
“Yeah, Kutta.” 
<br>
“Why such scorn for such a sundar [pretty, Hindi] face?” The forehead lining the fauji cut below, the lines from years of some turmoil. A small scar on his cheek, a consequence of a mother’s rage over a child’s mischief. Sharp jawline over shaved with a cheap blade.  
<br>
“I am a kutta.” 
<br>
I kept silent. My silence was felt and responded to by strange words from poor mouth. 
<br>
“I fawn on those who give me anything, I yelp at those who refuse, and I set my teeth in rascals.” Poor said looking down at my barely developed penis. Poor face changed as if the sight reminded fauji something dreadful, or disgusting. 
<br>
 I brush it off. I could already feel fauji nerve twitch. Poor turned pulling his penis out to relieve poorself on the same bush I rest my face on, to calm the twitch from the disgust, I am guessing. Another respect where fauji takes after a dog. In Delhi, however, you can find many such dogs, on fours and on twos, on many such corners. Corners congested with chatter, smoke, pee and dust. I noticed the leaves changed color to dark lush green contrasting to the dusty ones yet to be blessed by a kutta. 
<br>
I found out that the bush was called the weeping fig. There was a feature on one of my consumer’s phone. He took a picture and a woman barked out from the phone; 
<br>
 “This is a Ficus Benjamina or weeping fig tree. The weeping fig collects dust/metal/pollen and carbon compound in the air” (Add more facts) <br>
<br>
In the air I breathe!  <br> 
<br>
The phone goes on, “Leaves have been used as an indicator or as monitors to trace metal pollution. Removal of dust from the ambient air is one of the important environmental services of the weeping fig.” <br>
<br>
So, it is not just my naïve human mind that needs to attach a purpose to every existence. Maybe the idea of purpose is just something that exists as a condition in this dusty chaos. A rickshaw puller in Munirka once said to me, “Believe it or not chhakke [obscene word for transgenders, Hindi,], I was born 47 years 3 months and 13 days ago so that I could take you, a chhakka, from here to that dhaba [Restaurant, Hindi]. If it was not for my existence, how would you eat today?”.  <br>
<br>
A week later I ran into him again, “Maan na maan chhakke, hum 47 saal 3 mahina aur 20 din pehle paida hue the taaki tujh chhake ko mootne le jae. Varna tu kaha moot ta?” <br>
<br>
I could imagine this entire city speak in the same manner. Every road, every street, every bench, every metro, every bus, every bush, every tree. Everywhere I went I could hear them, and I could see and feel the dust that covered them.  <br>
<br>
“I was born 12 years 9 months and 2 days ago so that you, a stranger, could sit on me and rest, if it was not for my existence, where would you enjoy your chai sutta [cigarette, Hindi slang]?” And a cough. <br>
<br>
“I was born 1 years 1 months and 10 days ago so that you, a stranger, could pee on me, if it was not for my existence, you would get UTI.” said the bush to Fauji. And a cough. <br>
<br>
Cough. Cough. Cough. That cough. Sickness plagues this entire city and everyone and everything in it. Cough. Cough. Cough. Is this weeping fig sick too? I can see it. Yes! The sickness on it! When a weeping fig gets sick it starts losing its leaves. They turned yellow very soon, then brown and then fell right off. (Change the wording, more details) Now there are a few leaves left on its pale lonely branches. All covered in fine dust, pee and ash. <br>   
<br>
Another conversation unfolded against this weeping fig. I believe it to have interested the fig as well. A scientist came stumbling towards me like a lost puppy. I can get a few answers from this kutta... and maybe a night cab fare too. <br>
<br>
“Do you see there is always mitti on these leaves?” I asked after the phat-phat-phat of our skins concluded. As he was rummaging through every pocket to gather my rupees. There must be at least 10 such pockets hidden here and there in his garments. Two in the front of the jeans, two on the back, one small one on the chest of the kurta, two side pockets in the kurta and another pouch that stays inside close to his gut. A chhakka has no need for that many pockets. I can fit most of my possessions in my cleavage.  <br>
<br>
“Yes, indeed I do...” lines appear on his forehead as he dives into another pocket in the back of the jeans, a small unsuspecting one inside the bigger obvious one. “...it is only possible after the state of dust pollution here in Delhi.” Ah! What a bore! Pollution!? Dust pollution? What nonsense! These people do not understand trees, or plants or themselves for that matter. Pollution! Ugh! I watch the sweat dancing on the lines of his forehead as he dives into another small hidden pocket in the inside of the jeans near his crotch. I cannot watch this little puppy squirming so much. <br>
<br>
“Ay raja the poor don’t get a bite of the daawat.” Poor thing, his face turned red.  <br>
<br>
“No, no I have...” cough. “Ah...” cough. “I had it...” cough. “...in one of these pockets...” cough. “...maybe I dropped when I...” cough. “...I will pay...” cough. “...will you...” cough. “...take Paytm?” cough. Huffing and puffing and in such turmoil, typical intellectual.  <br>
<br>
“Raja you take off me that I must have and insult me with your naivete.” I say crouching down plucking a dusty leaf from the weeping fig. He looks embarrassed enough. <br>
<br>
“Why don’t you tell me little more about this and we will call it even.” I hand him over the leaf as confusion clouds his eyes behind glasses. He rubs the leaf between his fingers and looks up at me with an eyebrow raised. “About the dust?”  <br>
<br>
He rubs the dust off the leaf. “Ahh!” A sound of relief!? I nodded frantically feeling a rush through my head at that sound.  <br>
<br>
“Well...okay...uh...fine anthropogenic particles are often observed around and over the stomata of city trees and bushes...I mean the dust.” He says getting more uncomfortable not understanding what is happening. <br>
<br>
“Raja I don’t understand this chootiya language”  <br>
<br>
“Stomata, it’s like lungs for leaves.” <br>
<br>
“They help the leave breathe?” I see him getting more comfortable with my questions. Pulling out a cigarette.  <br>
<br>
“Yeah, breathing, like air,” he says lighting the cigarette. <br>
<br>
“The dust must be hurting its lungs then... that’s what that ‘ahh’ was about.” <br>
<br>
{{{To that time that went away we would not go away till the time of my life.  I can only be looking for the station of interest in another tie. It will be of prime significance till my time of that day. Only then can there be another person of interest to be mentioned in the state of affairs. At any moment there could be any time for my life to change it’s course. I could mention the moments of my life that you took away from me. But I am here looking for my pieces in the present now. All that I cannot be and everything I will be. Holding on to them to my chest, pressing hard into my skin }}}
<br>
“What? What ahh?” <br>
<br>
“Nothing” I say quickly, it's better I don’t come out as a fanatic. <br>
<br>
“Waah bhenchod look at this what a sight.” He says, feeling much more comfortable now with smoke filling his own lungs. “A hijra interested in science.” <br>
<br>
“And why not?” I clap-clap-clap with flat palms striking against each other, with the fingers spread limply, making sure all his attention is on me. “I can think like you and like what you’re not!” He laughed, nodding in response. <br>
<br>
“It may affect the physiological characteristics of leaves. The dust I mean.” He tosses the butt away pulling another cigarette out. “Both fine and coarse particles are responsible for increase in leaf temperature and decrease in light absorption...” he stares at me as if expecting something. Getting nothing but a confused look. “It hinders in photosynthesis...” again nothing. “Hay bhagwaan! ...chootiya aurat it hurts the leaf a lot.” He says leaning against the wall thinking of something more to say but I have heard enough. Such a tragic being! What a moribund state of existence! <br>
<br>
     I know now, it is not just me that is bothered by this city. The weeping fig holds as many grudges as me. A soothing realization of shared grief takes over my being. It is losing its’ lush green and cool. All to this city and its dust. I hear that cough again. The dust that covers these leaves, the trees, the streets, is the same that covers my face, and the faces of everyone who lives in this city. Everyone is spending their nights face down in dust-covered bushes. One here another there. One way or another, everyone must spread their butt holes to the phat-phat-phat of something. Even the city is designed in a manner so there are plenty of bushes for every one of us. And plenty of dust.  <br>
<br>
Phat-phat-phat. “They also do not like overwatering.” Phat-phat-phat. “Too much damp is bad for this bush.” Phat-Phat-Phat. “You should not pee here this too often.”  <br>
<br>
“Ugh!” Fauji groaned.  <br>
<br>
 Phat-phat-phat “Ah!” Phat-phat-phat. “As for my sweat, it just cleans the dust off its leaves.” Phat-Phat “uh!” Fauji finished with the usual uff.  “I am sure the fig loves it.” Poor says clearly annoyed. I have been thinking more of this collaboration that plays between me and this bush. (Elaborate on the biology of the plant, elaborate on the character of the plant, grow) <br>

{{{{In me penetrates what involuntarily belongs to others, inhospitable like music and blind in my blood, transforming, passes. There with the sun I rise and already from outside has the noise of this city inside my being, penetrating, phat-phat-phat.  <br>

 The day ends and a silent collaboration is happening between the organs and cells of this city, continuing with us. Without any thought to if we want the end results of this collaboration to play out, maybe one day tired of all our assaults, it will decide it does not want to breathe in and out. Can they not halt this assault on this city’s lungs? The collaboration continues anyways, like that of sound and silence. It is there no matter what, “even in the most silent of silences.” And then there is that cough again. I am so tired and so covered in dust. I fall asleep, weeping. (Elaborate more on the collective grief, introduce and grow better on the concept of shared existence, work on the conclusion) <br>

Now, I linger, now move on, as the day and dust with the wind pass through me, as though this dust was slowly thinking thoughts for me. I gaze at the dusty weeping fig; it’s gaze however, dusty with glittering haze. (Grow this into an anomaly)  <br>

As I decay, or let the flames turn me to ashes, I will become dust and it me. Becoming a particle smaller than 100 micrometers in diameter. Wind and bees will carry me and spread me across this city, perhaps a butterfly will flutter its wings just enough so that I settle on some weeping fig in some corner. And by settling on that weeping fig and nothing more, my destiny; fulfilled. To be fulfilled by the lengths of the demands of the protagonist. }}}}}</p>
