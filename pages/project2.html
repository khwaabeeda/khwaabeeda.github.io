      A Weeping Fig in the City. 
<br>
 <br>
<br>
There was a burning sensation in my left eye, I blinked the blurriness away. It was a <br>bead of sweat that rolled down the forehead of the man above me. He was looking <br>straight, to avoid looking directly at me. Breathing harder than it pains, the sweat <br>dripped down from his head to his cheeks and nose, and jaw, some butterfly in the <br>blossoming Mughal Garden fluttered its wings only to hush the sweat just enough so <br>that it fell right into my eye. Meanwhile I was crouching with my face down in a <br>dusty bush on a corner of the Jawaharlal Nehru University. The man was below average,<br> too skinny and in too much of a fuss for his profession, only owning up to <br>his pronouns; poor/Fauji, poor self/Fauji self. Poor was like many other people in <br>poor’s profession, too far from reality, keeping poor eyes and Fauji mind diverted <br>just enough so poor could shoot a load down my ass.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I had trouble breathing, forty degrees of scorching heat, crouching face down in the <br>bushes, the leaves covered in dust acted as a pillow for me to rest my face on, <br>butt hole expanding to the phat-phat-phat of skin slapping together. <br>I heard a cough; it was not poor. Back to my face down in the bushes, phat-phat-phat, <br>Fauji sweat dropped on my lips and I intuitively licked-licked-licked. There it was, the dust,<br> gnashing my teeth. With much effort, I turned my head just enough to see that <br>Poor was covered in dust poor self.Had Fauji spent some nights with Fauji face in the <br>dusty bushes? Was poor one of the many faces that rested on these bushes? Had poor <br>thought about the bushes the way I did? If it was true then the same dust covered our <br>faces. Like all the other faces in that congested city. Sometimes in the most silent <br>of silences, I could hear that city cough. <br>
<br>
<br>
 Sometimes I dreamt of poor, kneeling between my legs and reality poking poor right in <br>Fauji face and down poor throat. Following a tear that rolled down poor eyes, another <br>butterfly fluttered its wings, and the tear hit a leaf covered thickly in dust. <br>Playing into a prerequisite dialogue. Interactions unfolded between particles solid or<br> liquid with a diameter smaller than 100 micrometers. Our interactions were limited <br>to that bush in a corner outside of Jawaharlal Nehru University.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I had only talked to Fauji once, and in that short and strange (in a good way) exchange <br>poor insisted I call poor ‘dog’. Following my idiosyncrasy of asking ‘why’ for <br>everything I got a short and strange (in a good way) answer.  <br>
<br>
<br>

“I fawn on those who give me anything, I yelp at those who refuse, and I set my teeth in <br>rascals” <br>
<br>
<br>
Poor looked down at my barely developed penis while saying that last part. I did not take<br> it personally; it was just a part of the job. The strangeness of the exchange was <br>obvious, the shortness of the exchange had more to do with me not wanting to lose a <br>nights’ work over my masculine voice. It must have rung like an alarm for his own <br>masculinity. I could already feel fauji nerve twitch. Immediately poor pulled his <br>penis out to relieve poorself on the same bush I rest my face on, to calm the twitch, <br>I am guessing. Another respect where fauji takes after a dog. In Delhi, however, you <br>can find many such dogs, on fours and on twos. The corner congested again with <br>silence, smoke, pee and dust.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile I found out that the bush was called the weeping fig. The weeping fig collects<br> dust/metal/pollen and carbon compound in the air I breathe. Leaves have been <br>used as an indicator or as monitors to trace metal pollution. Removal of dust from the <br>ambient air is one of the important environmental services of the weeping fig. Is it <br>just my naïve human mind that needs to attach a purpose to every existence? Or is the <br>idea of purpose just something that exists as a condition in this dusty chaos. A <br>rickshaw puller in Chandi Chawk once said to me, “Believe it or not memsahab, I was <br>born 47 years 3 months and 13 days ago so that I could take you, a stranger, from here <br>to that dhaba. If it was not for my existence, how would you eat today?”. A week later <br>I found him again, this time to go from the metro station to the public toilet, and he <br>said, “Believe it or not memsahab, I was born 47 years 3 months and 20 days ago so <br>that I could take you, a stranger, from here to that mootavas. If it was not for my <br>existence, how would you pee today?”. I could imagine this entire city talk in the <br>same manner. Every road, every street, every bench, every metro, every bus, every <br>bush, every tree. Everywhere I went I could hear them. <br>
<br> 
<br>
“I was born 12 years 9 months and 2 days ago so that you, a stranger, could sit on me and <br>rest, if it was not for my existence, where would you enjoy your chai sutta?” And a <br>cough. <br>
<br> 
<br>
“I was born 1 years 1 months and 14 days ago so that you, a stranger, could pee on me, if <br>it was not for my existence, you would get UTI.” And a cough. <br>
<br>
<br>
Cough. Cough. Cough. That cough, I think, is an indicator of a sickness. A sickness that <br>plagues this entire city and everyone and everything in it. Cough. Cough. Cough. Is <br>this weeping fig sick too? I can see it. Yes! The sickness on it! When a weeping fig <br>gets sick it starts losing its leaves. The first time I put my face on it, <br>phat-phat-phat, was 4 years ago and it was just a baby, lush and full of deep green leaves. <br>They turned yellow very soon, then brown and then fell right off. Now there are a few <br>leaves left on its pale lonely branches. All covered in fine dust, pee and ash.  <br>
<br>  
<br>
A conversation once unfolded against this same weeping fig, between me and a scientist. <br>Fauji brought him along. A night of adventure for poor. Both mine and scientists’ face<br> was resting on this weeping fig. He told me that fine anthropogenic particles <br>were often observed around and over the stomata of city trees and bushes which may <br>affect the physiological characteristics of leaves. Both fine and coarse particles are<br> responsible for increase in leaf temperature and decrease in light absorption <br>(hindering in photosynthesis). So, it is not just me that is bothered by this city.<br> The weeping fig holds as many grudges as me. It is losing its’ lush green and <br>the shine. All to this city and its dust. I hear that cough again. The dust that <br>covers these leaves, the trees, the streets, is the same that covers my face, and the <br>faces of everyone who lives in this city. Everyone is spending their nights face down <br>in dust-covered bushes. One here another there. One way or another, everyone has to <br>spread their butt holes to the phat-phat-phat of something. Even the city is designed<br> in a manner so there are plenty of bushes for every one of us. And plenty dust. <br>
<br> 
<br>
Phat-phat-phat. “They also do not like overwatering.” The scientist is a talker. But I do<br> not mind. Too much damp is bad for this bush. Fauji should not pee here this too <br>often. As for my sweat, it just cleans the dust off its leaves. I am sure the fig <br>loves it. Phat-phat-phat. It’s a collaboration that plays between me and this bush. <br>
<br> 
<br>
 I return to my room thinking a silent collaboration is happening between the organs and <br>cells of this city, continuing with us. Without any thought to if we want the end <br>results of this collaboration to play out, maybe one day tired of all our assaults, it<br> will decide it does not want to breathe in and out. Can they not halt this assault <br>on this city’s lungs? The collaboration continues anyways, like that of sound and <br>silence. It is there no matter what, “even in the most silent of silences.” And then <br>there is that cough again. I am so tired and so covered in dust. I fall asleep <br>weeping. <br>
