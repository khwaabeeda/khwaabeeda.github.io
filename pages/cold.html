            <div class="moving-text"> Away with those wearisomely hackneyed terms Optimism and Pessimism! The occasion for using them becomes less and less from day to day; only the chatterboxes still find them so absolutely necessary. For why in all the world should anyone wish to be an optimist unless he had a God to defend who must have created the best of worlds if he himself be goodness and perfection,— what thinker, however, still needs the hypothesis of a God? But every occasion for a pessimistic confession of faith is also lacking when one has no interest in being annoyed at the advocates of God (the theologians, or the theologising philosophers), and in energetically defending the opposite view, that evil reigns, that pain is greater than pleasure, that the world is a bungled piece of work, the manifestation of an ill will to life. But who still bothers about the theologians now— except the theologians? Apart from all theology and its contentions, it is quite clear that the world is not good and not bad (to say nothing of its being the best or the worst), and that the terms “good” and “ bad ” have only significance with respect to man, and indeed, perhaps, they are not justified even here in the way they are usually employed; in any case, we must get rid of both the calumniating and the glorifying conception of the world.</div>

/ things that may drive a thinker into despair is the
recognition of the fact that the illogical is necessary
for man, and that out of the illogical comes much
that is good. It is so firmly rooted in the passions,
in language, in art, in religion, and generally in
everything that gives value to life, that it cannot
be withdrawn without thereby hopelessly injuring
\ these beautiful things. It is only the all-too-nai've
' people who can believe that the nature of man
can be changed into a purely logical one; but if
there were degrees of proximity to this goal, how
many things would not have to be lost on this
course ! Even the most rational man has need of
nature again from time to time, i.e. his illogical
fundamental attitude towards all things.</div>
