  <h1>The Bird with the Broken Leg</h1>
  <img id="image" src="assets/whitebird.png" alt="Bouncing Image">

<p class="line-height-example"> What is the loss of a leg to her. She. The majestic, the beautiful, she who can fly. What is the loss of a leg to her, the eloquent one who can fly. What is this loss but just a slight inconvenience to her? 
  <br>
She has never roamed the grounds like the unfortunate flightless! Like the horrid ones stuck between the Ohs and the Ahs! This is Kishtwar. It is a small valley, surrounded by huge magnificent mountains. Early morning you can hear the echo of the temple bells, and throughout the day you can lose yourself in the hymns of azan. The peaks are always covered in a bit of white, and the ground in a bit of red.   
<br>
  Does she too just close her eyes and let the hymns of azan and the bells of the aarti sooth her troubled heart? What troubles is this winged goddess trying to forget? Does she fear the coming of an end just like the flightless? Over whom she takes flight with full grace. Why would she mourn he troubles of land, when she owns the skies. Does she ever dream of her toes and talons soiled in blood? 
<br>
Does she shiver at the screams and screeches coming from the ground? Are my cries audible to her when she flies high above me? These days she chirps at dawn. It sounds unlike any other of her chirping, its more melancholic. She seems exhausted. From flying? Does she think about the cries that leave my throat like I think of her chirping? I was hoping that she too wonders about what bothers me. But seems like she is oblivious to my earthly willows.
And then one day, she lands on the tree that shades my despair, and then she talks. I had this absolute sense that it was talk only for me, to anyone else who might have encountered our exchange I must have seemed dull. A flightless human being talking to a chirping bird. And so, she chirped sitting on the densest branch of my tree of despair.</p>

  <strong><em>"In a world purely based on cosmic connections, how is that I live with so much displacement in my heart? I have these hearts above and below, all <br>around me, on ground and in the heavens. All beating, all exerting energy and producing heat. A collaboration of a bunch of tissues working together in <br>harmony to sustain such tragic beings. When I am flying high in deep content of the heavens, I am disrupted every few days with this smoke that blocks <br>my sky. What is this smoke? A rebellion against the homeostatic universe? Who are these idiots who would do such a thing? Is it those horrid monkeys? <br>Such disdain hearts! What a waste! O! What a waste of so much beautiful energy! I was so exhausted! So breathless! I was breathing hard and flying <br>around in this breathlessness! I crashed on this tree like it was asking me, no! Telling me! It was commanding me! Crash on me! Rest on me! It was such <br>a hushed command. I almost missed it! No! Oh no! Ah! No calm here! How is it that these flightless are able to breathe here?  How are they not <br>breathless here!? This place! Ah! It is not meant to sustain my beating heart! Ah! These monkeys! These horrid monkeys!" </strong></em>
<br>
<p class="line-height-example">I hear the words but I do not understand them, I know their meaning, I understand the sentence formation, I know them, but I do not really know. But I do understand something, I feel a sense of belongingness in them. I look at her with a blank expression, and I think she senses is too, the sense of belongingness on my blank face. And staring at it she falls; she falls from the dense branch, hitting many other branches, many leaves and right on my heart. Eyes closed, calm and then I sense something again, something seemingly foreign, yet earthly. A sense of belonging. Her wings slowly turn black. I weep. This belonging, there is so much pain in it! Take it away! Take it away! Fly away! But she does not, instead she opens her eyes and hops to her single feet. One of her feet is broken, simply not there. And thatâ€™s how she remains now, hoping on her talons and toes, right beside me. And so, the sense of belonging remains, and so does the pain. We have many vivid conversations, me and her. </p>
