   <h1>The Bird with the Broken Leg </h1> <br> 
                                 

<p1><br>What is the loss of a leg to her. She. The majestic, the beautiful, she who can fly. What is the loss of a leg to her, the eloquent one who can fly. <br>What is this loss but just a slight inconvenience to her? <br></p1>
<br>
<p2><br>She has never roamed the grounds like the unfortunate flightless! Like the horrid ones stuck between the Ohs and the Ahs! This is Kishtwar. It is a <br>small valley, surrounded by huge magnificent mountains. Early morning you can hear the echo of the temple bells, and throughout the day you can lose <br>yourself in the hymns of azan. The peaks are always covered in a bit of white, and the ground in a bit of red. </p2>
<br>
<p3><br>Does she too just close her eyes and let the hymns of azan and the bells of the aarti sooth her troubled heart? What troubles is this winged <br>goddess trying to forget? Does she fear the coming of an end just like the flightless? Over whom she takes flight with full grace. Why would she mourn <br>the troubles of land, when she owns the skies. Does she ever dream of her toes and talons soiled in blood? </p3> 
<br>
<br><p4>Does she shiver at the screams and screeches coming from the ground? Are my cries audible to her when she flies high above me? These days she <br>chirps at dawn. It sounds unlike any other of her chirping, its more melancholic. She seems exhausted. From flying? Does she think about the cries that <br>leave my throat like I think of her chirping? I was hoping that she too wonders about what bothers me. But seems like she is oblivious to my earthly <br>willows.</p4>  
<br>
<p5><br>And then one day, she lands on the tree that shades my despair, and then she talks. I had this absolute sense that it was talk only for me, to <br>anyone else who might have encountered our exchange I must have seemed dull. A flightless human being talking to a chirping bird. And so, she chirped <br>sitting on the densest branch of my tree of despair.</p5>

<br><p7><strong><em>In a world purely based on cosmic connections, how is that I live with so much displacement in my heart? I have these hearts above and below, all <br>around me, on ground and in the heavens. All beating, all exerting energy and producing heat. A collaboration of a bunch of tissues working together in <br>harmony to sustain such tragic beings. When I am flying high in deep content of the heavens, I am disrupted every few days with this smoke that blocks <br>my sky. What is this smoke? A rebellion against the homeostatic universe? Who are these idiots who would do such a thing? Is it those horrid monkeys? <br>Such disdain hearts! What a waste! O! What a waste of so much beautiful energy! I was so exhausted! So breathless! I was breathing hard and flying <br>around in this breathlessness! I crashed on this tree like it was asking me, no! Telling me! It was commanding me! Crash on me! Rest on me! It was such <br>a hushed command. I almost missed it! No! Oh no! Ah! No calm here! How is it that these flightless are able to breathe here?  How are they not <br>breathless here!? This place! Ah! It is not meant to sustain my beating heart! Ah! These monkeys! These horrid monkeys! </p7></strong></em>

                                <br>
<br><p8>I hear the words but I do not understand them, I know their meaning, I understand the sentence formation, I know them, but I do not really know. <br>But I do understand something, I feel a sense of belongingness in them. I look at her with a blank expression, and I think she senses is too, the sense <br>of belongingness on my blank face. And staring at it she falls; she falls from the dense branch, hitting many other branches, many leaves and right on <br>my heart. Eyes closed, calm and then I sense something again, something seemingly foreign, yet earthly. A sense of belonging. Her wings slowly turn <br>black. I weep. This belonging, there is so much pain in it! Take it away! Take it away! Fly away! But she does not, instead she opens her eyes and hops <br>to her single feet. One of her feet is broken, simply not there. And thatâ€™s how she remains now, hoping on her talons and toes, right beside me. And <br>so, the sense of belonging remains, and so does the pain. We have many vivid conversations, me and her. </p8>
