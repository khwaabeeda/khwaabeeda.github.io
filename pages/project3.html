                                <h1> Oh God, Wherefore didst thee Cutteth off the Penis off Eve?</h1> <br> 
 <br>
<br>
In my previous life I must have been a dildo; a sinner. Some De Sade freak must have <br>had me hidden in his Victorian panty drawer. I must have fucked many Victorian-scented asses to have cluttered up so much bad karma so as to have had this life. Now you will slaughter me kind madam and tell me no karma weighed on the Victorians. But the fact is, and you will agree, that sin prevails in all religions and all cultures and tales and all beliefs that foster up from all of these tales, cultures, and religions. I read somewhere that Dharma is like rules of the universe. To be in violation of them is not a sin, but in a way just ignorance. Me, I was always born into some club, you can call it a sex club for your convenience. I call it the club of the humiliated and the insulted. How much of a violation is it to be in it?  <br>
<br>
No escape from ignorance on no land, on no high sky. People like me are anyway found under a rock, no escaping from this sin here either. But this time, I believe, I will be paying for all my sins in the present life and will not be carrying anything for the next one. For in the next one, I think I should be a Japanese love pillow. If only I was asked for my preferences they would go as follows; <br>
<br>
1. A Japanese Love cushion. <br>
<br>
2. A mountain in a cold desert. <br>
<br>
3. The thing on cricketer’s penises that protect their penises from any harm. <br>
<br>
I was planning to pay for all sins, past present and coming, in this life. I think I can because I read somewhere, ‘Man has to pay for his sins of this life, in this life and no other.’ Of course, I am a woman, but a vagina offers no escape from the sin either. In fact, this very vagina is now the perpetrator of all my sins. I, when no one is looking, put my hands in my pants and touch my vagina. 
      <br>
      By this, I do not mean that I masturbate. No that is too complex. I just put my hand in to put it over the controversial opening between my legs and keep it there. Like an inspection or an assurance. Reminding myself or assuring myself that it is still there. Some Freudian will pop up now and say that I was looking for a penis. Well too bad, it is not there. Instead, there is this slit, it smells weird and always leaves my underwear yellow and me ashamed. Freud wins, I am envious.
      <br>
      Sometimes instead of just putting my hand over it, I move the hand to a little side and scratch. This scratch, is it something from a phantom penis? That would mean that while God took a rib from Adam, he took a penis off Eve. Poor Eve. Why, there is my enemy; my vagina. It spoke ill of me, defamed, and shamed me. In secret, I have moments of love with it. We are like old schoolmates. That old scoundrel! How can I forget that we fancy each other and regularly complement our scars? At times it carries me to a distant corner, but I understand that it's jealous and needs attention. It is thinking "kill, kill.", at this moment I sing truce and bow to it. Then my enemy, my old mate takes the form of Ingelow and sings, "But, O my first, O my best, I could not choose but love thee."(Ingelow, p. 50) <br>
<br>
      When I am in dilemma about how to deal with this nasty habit associated with my enemy, I think to myself, “Well I have indulged in nastier sins than this.” <br> 
<br>
Only in humiliation, do I find my release. I press my thighs tight into each other, the wetness between my walls, the material proof of my humiliation. An evil desire, the worst of all sins. There must be be more humiliated and insulted hiding this dampness between their thighs. Is there a secret club of the abused and the insulted? Surely Arendt worked on it, but no one took it forward. I have worked on it too.
<br>
 I have given my fears and all the abuse a physical form, of a man. A big man, a heavy beard, a strong man, rough hands, and a tight grip. This man, I have with much effort chosen him to take on this task, is a social hero; a soldier. A defender of national integrity; a political hero. His mythical shallow masculine social status is of importance to my humiliation. It serves a purpose to my abuse. He releases a drag of his smoke into my face, making me cough. He is angry. The poor pack of gold flake has been promising his death that he so wants to embrace with full arms. But that is just another tale of failures. I crawl to this man, my head down, my ago at rest and being reduced to that of a dog. Because I am my own pain and I have named this pain dog. Like any other Nietzschean dog, it is “just as faithful, just as obtrusive and shameless, just as entertaining.” <br>
