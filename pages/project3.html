                                <h1> Oh God, Wherefore didst thee Cutteth off the Penis off Eve?</h1> <br> 
 <br>
<br>
In my previous life I must have been a dildo; a sinner. Some De Sade freak must have <br>had me hidden in his Victorian panty drawer. I must have fucked many a Victorian <br>scented asses to have cluttered up so much bad karma so as to have had this life. Now<br> you will slaughter me kind madam and tell me no karma weighed on the <br>Victorians. But the fact is, and you will agree, that sin prevails in all <br>religions and all cultures and tales and all believes that foster up from all of <br>these tales, cultures, and religions. I read somewhere that Dharma is like rules <br>of the universe. To be in violation of them is not a sin, but in a way just ignorance. <br>Me, I was always born into some club, you can call it a sex club for <br>your convenience. I call it the club of the humiliated and the insulted. How much <br>of a violation is it to be in it?  <br>
<br>
No escape from ignorance on no land, on no high sky. People like me are anyways found <br>under a rock, no escaping from this sin here either. But this time, I believe, I <br>will be paying for all my sins in the present life and will not be carrying <br>anything for the next one. For in the next one I am thinking I should be a <br>Japanese love pillow. If only I was asked for my preferences they would go as <br>follows; <br>
<br>
1.Japanese Love cushion. <br>
<br>
2.A mountain in a cold desert. <br>
<br>
3.The thing on cricketer’s penises that protect their penises from any harm. <br>
<br>
I was planning to pay for all sins, past present and coming, in this life. I think I <br>can because I read somewhere, ‘Man has to pay for his sins of this life, in this <br>life and no other.’ Of course, I am a woman, but a vagina offers no escape from <br>the sin either. In fact, this very vagina is now the perpetrator of all my sins. <br> I, when no one is looking, put my hands in my pants and touch my <br>vagina. By this, I do not mean that I masturbate. No that is too complex. I just <br>put my hand in to put it over the controversial opening between my legs and keep <br>it there. Like an inspection or an assurance. Reminding myself or assuring myself <br>that it is still there. Some Freudian will pop up now and say that I was looking <br>for a penis. Well too bad, it is not there. Instead, there is this slit, it smells<br> weird and always leaves my underwear yellow and me ashamed. Freud wins, I <br>am envious. Sometimes instead of just putting my hand over it, I move the hand to <br>a little side and scratch. This scratch, is it something from a phantom penis? <br>That would mean that while God took a rib from Adam, he took a penis off Eve. Poor<br> Eve. Why, there is my enemy; my vagina. It spoke ill of me, defamed, and <br>shamed me. In secret, I have moments of love with it. We are like old school <br>mates. That old scoundrel! How can I forget that we fancy each other and regularly <br>complement our scars? At times it carries me to a distant corner, but I understand <br>that it's jealous and needs attention. It is thinking "kill, kill.", at this <br>moment I sing truce and bow to it. Then my enemy, my old mate takes the form of <br>Ingelow and sings "But, O my first, O my best, I could not choose but love <br>thee."(Ingelow, p. 50)1  <br>
<br>
      When I am in dilemma about how to deal with this nasty habit associated with my <br>enemy, I think to myself, “Well I have indulged in nastier sins than this.” <br> 
<br>
<br>
Only in humiliation, do I find my release. I press my thighs tight into each other,<br> the wetness between my walls, the material proof of my humiliation. An evil <br>desire, the worst of all sins. There have to be more humiliated and insulted <br>hiding this dampness between their thighs. Is there a secret club of the <br>abused and the insulted? Surely Arendt worked on it, no one took it forward. I <br>have worked on it too.<br> 
<br>
<br>
 I have given my fears and all the abuse a physical form, of a man. A big man, a heavy <br>beard, a strong man, rough hands, and tight grip. This man, I have with much <br>effort chosen him to take on this task, is a social hero; a soldier. A defender of<br> national integrity; a political hero. His mythical shallow masculine social <br>status is of importance to my humiliation. It serves a purpose to my abuse. He <br>releases a drag of his smoke into my face, making me cough. He is angry. The poor<br> pack of gold flake has been promising his death that he so wants to embrace <br>with full arms. But that is just another tale of failures. I crawl to this man, my<br> head down, my ago at rest and being reduced that of a dog. Because I am my own <br>pain and I have named this pain dog. Like any other Nietzschean dog it is “just as<br> faithful, just as obtrusive and shameless, just as entertaining.” <br>
